    <h1>Why static?</h1>
    <p>Dynamic websites, which use Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Python, or a multitude of other platforms, generate content for their users on request-by-request basis. Because the server creates the page when the user sends a request, it can ensure that they will receive content that is up-to-date, or if it knows who the user is, content that is specifically made for that user. This is incredibly powerful; without it, sites like Facebook, Amazon, or PayPal could not exist, at least in any way remotely similar to the way they do today. In fact, any website that allows you to <u>do</u> anything is virtually required to be dynamic.</p>
    <p>However, many websites (the vast majority, in my estimation) are not for doing anything. Rather, they are for seeing things. They are the books and the flyers and the signs of the internet. These are the local business websites you visit to find out if they take walk-ins or appointments. They are the pages with information about a festival or event you are interested in. They don't let you <u>do</u> anything, because that's not what they are for. These are static websites.</p>
    <p>Static websites support no end-user features that are not also supported by dynamic sites. Everything they offer is for the web designers who make them. Specifically, static sites are much more predictable when it comes to styling and appearance. Web designers already have to try to predict how different browsers and different versions of browsers will interpret their code, as well as account for any reasonable dimensions their site may be rendered within. With static sites, designers can at least know their content will remain unchanged.</p>
